# GraphRAG MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server for querying a hybrid graph and vector database system, combining Neo4j (graph database) and Qdrant (vector database) for powerful semantic and graph-based document retrieval.

## Overview

GraphRAG MCP provides a seamless integration between large language models and a hybrid retrieval system that leverages the strengths of both graph databases (Neo4j) and vector databases (Qdrant). This enables:

- Semantic search through document embeddings
- Graph-based context expansion following relationships
- Hybrid search combining vector similarity with graph relationships
- Full integration with Claude and other LLMs through MCP

This project follows the [Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) specification, making it compatible with any MCP-enabled client.

## Features

- **Semantic search** using sentence embeddings and Qdrant
- **Graph-based context expansion** using Neo4j
- **Hybrid search** combining both approaches
- **MCP tools and resources** for LLM integration
- Full documentation of Neo4j schema and Qdrant collection information

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Neo4j running on localhost:7687 (default configuration)
- Qdrant running on localhost:6333 (default configuration)
- Document data indexed in both databases

## Installation

### Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rileylemm/graphrag_mcp.git
   cd graphrag_mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies with uv:

   [Video explaining `uv`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4qh83m1jg0)

   To get started, I needed to get `uv` installed. This took some
   experimentation. Along the way I installed pipx and poetry, probably
   unnecessarily. Finally hit on this, that I could probably have done
   without any of them. The `uv sync` command is equivalent to the old
   `pip install -r requirements.txt` command, but it uses `pyproject.toml`
   and is much better parallelized.

   ```bash
   $ curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   $ uv venv
   $ source .venv/bin/activate
   $ uv sync
   ```

3. Configure your database connections in the `.env` file:
   ```
   # Neo4j Configuration
   NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
   NEO4J_USER=neo4j
   NEO4J_PASSWORD=password

   # Qdrant Configuration
   QDRANT_HOST=localhost
   QDRANT_PORT=6333
   QDRANT_COLLECTION=document_chunks
   ```

4. Run the server:
   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

### Detailed Setup Guide

For a detailed guide on setting up the underlying hybrid database system, please refer to the companion repository: [GraphRAG Hybrid Database](https://github.com/rileylemm/graphrag-hybrid)

#### Setting up Neo4j and Qdrant

1. Install and start Neo4j:
   ```bash
   # Using Docker
   docker run \
     --name neo4j \
     -p 7474:7474 -p 7687:7687 \
     -e NEO4J_AUTH=neo4j/password \
     -v $HOME/neo4j/data:/data \
     -v $HOME/neo4j/logs:/logs \
     -v $HOME/neo4j/import:/import \
     -v $HOME/neo4j/plugins:/plugins \
     neo4j:latest
   ```

2. Install and start Qdrant:
   ```bash
   # Using Docker
   docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
     -v $HOME/qdrant/storage:/qdrant/storage \
     qdrant/qdrant
   ```

#### Indexing Documents

To index your documents in both databases, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your documents
2. Create embeddings using sentence-transformers
3. Store documents in Neo4j with relationship information
4. Store document chunk embeddings in Qdrant

Refer to the [GraphRAG Hybrid Database](https://github.com/rileylemm/graphrag-hybrid) repository for detailed indexing scripts and procedures.

## Integration with MCP Clients

### Claude Desktop / Cursor Integration

1. Make the run script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_server.sh
   ```

2. Add the server to your MCP configuration file (`~/.cursor/mcp.json` or Claude Desktop equivalent):
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "GraphRAG": {
         "command": "/path/to/graphrag_mcp/run_server.sh",
         "args": []
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Restart your MCP client (Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.)

## Usage

### MCP Tools

This server provides the following tools for LLM use:

1. `search_documentation` - Search for information using semantic search
   ```python
   # Example usage in MCP context
   result = search_documentation(
       query="How does graph context expansion work?",
       limit=5,
       category="technical"
   )
   ```

2. `hybrid_search` - Search using both semantic and graph-based approaches
   ```python
   # Example usage in MCP context
   result = hybrid_search(
       query="Vector similarity with graph relationships",
       limit=10,
       category=None,
       expand_context=True
   )
   ```

### MCP Resources

The server provides the following resources:

1. `https://graphrag.db/schema/neo4j` - Information about the Neo4j graph schema
2. `https://graphrag.db/collection/qdrant` - Information about the Qdrant vector collection

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection issues**: Ensure Neo4j and Qdrant are running and accessible
- **Empty results**: Check that your document collection is properly indexed
- **Missing dependencies**: Run `uv install` to ensure all packages are installed
- **Database authentication**: Verify credentials in your `.env` file
